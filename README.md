# SMRTXE_Project
Here is my main project folder where I work on new functions and test existing code. Contains graphics and ST7586 library (the graphics library modified to be used with the ST7586 and it's lack to read the display memory back).
Also, I've just added functions to use the keyboard and memory IC.
